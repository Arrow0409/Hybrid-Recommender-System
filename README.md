# Revolutionizing Learning: Building a Next-Generation System for LMS Platform
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a next-generation recommendation system for Learning Management Systems (LMS) platforms. This project aims to enhance user engagement and learning outcomes by providing personalized recommendations for technical courses and books.
## Key Features:
- **Hybrid Filtering:** Combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for more accurate and relevant recommendations.
- **Cold Start Mitigation:** Addressing the cold start problem by leveraging both user and item metadata.
- **Scalability and Efficiency:** Designed to handle large datasets and user interactions.
- **User-Centric Design:** Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve recommendation quality.
- **Adaptive Recommendations:** Tailoring recommendations to user preferences and demographics.
## Technologies Used:
- Python: Primary programming language.
- Flask: Web framework for creating the web application.
- SQL (MySQL): For data storage and retrieval.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, demographic filtering, and hybrid filtering techniques.
